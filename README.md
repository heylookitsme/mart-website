A run down of the class
- we make art
- learn a little bit of math 
- as you can probably tell. 
- math level required: literally none. can you add and substract? thats enough 
- of course, a deeper understanding of math might give you the foundation to do more stuff 
- and of course, a foundation in art of deeper understanding of design will let you make some really cool stuff & allow you to utilize some awesome art tools
